## 🚨 Introduction

The Internet has become an indispensable part of modern life, but it also opens doors for cyber threats such as **phishing attacks**.  
Phishing websites deceive users into sharing sensitive information — such as usernames, passwords, or banking details — by impersonating legitimate websites.

This project focuses on detecting **phishing URLs** using **machine learning algorithms** that classify URLs as *legitimate* or *phishing* based on extracted features.  
By leveraging powerful classification algorithms and feature analysis, the project achieves a high accuracy rate and is deployed through a simple **Flask web interface**.
